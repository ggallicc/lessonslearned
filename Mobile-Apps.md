#Mobile Apps - 3 Types to Consider (Hybrid, Cross Platform, Native)
#Hybrid:
  Ex: PhoneGap - Free open source software to bundle code for appstore.
  Advantages of Hybrid Apps: Can leverage existing web content and resources, single codebase across devices, lowest cost option
  Disadvantages of Hybrid Apps: Limited functionality to take advantage of advanced smartphone hardware features
  Timeframe/Cost: Simple App 3-6 months, $10K
#Cross Platform:
  Framework Examples: Appcelerator (java), Xamarin (.net, c#)
  Advantages of Cross Platform Apps: Single code base for all platforms, most cost effective for multiple platforms, deep hardware integration, compiles to native, fairly quick to market, great for corporate type applications.
  Disadvantages of Cross Platform Apps: Might require licensing fees, less flexibility with UI/UX as compared to native, lag time for native hardware features, not good for games.
  Timeframe/Cost: Simple App 6 months, $10-$50k
#Native:
  Ex: Swift, Jave
  Advantages of Native Apps: Highest performance, can take full advantage of hardware and 3rd party integration, future proof - can continue to rework existing code, only real option for gaming / imersive experiences.
  Disadvantages of Native Apps: Most expensive option, deed separate development teams for each platform (IOS, Android)

Once you decide what mobile app to design, you need to see if you want to start with Android or iOS first. Here is a link that talks about the trade-offs! One idea mentioned in the article is to analyze the website traffic and see whether Android or iOS have more traffic share. I think this is a pragmatic approach.
